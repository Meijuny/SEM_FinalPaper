- Then click 'Select Variables': find 'Politics, including: political interest, efficacy, trust,electoral and other forms of participation, party allegiance, socio-political orientations' and click the 'ESS standard variables, Politcs' under this section;
- Tick the 3 varaibles we need for perceived ethnic threat: **imbgeco** (immigration bad or good for country's economy) / **imueclt** (Country's cultural life undermined or enriched by immigrants) / **imwbcnt** (Immigrants make country worse or better place to live)
